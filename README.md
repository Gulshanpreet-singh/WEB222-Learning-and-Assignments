### POINTS TO NOTE

# Disclaimer
Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [Academic Integrity](https://www.senecacollege.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) policy of the course.
